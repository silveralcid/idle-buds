## General Systems

### Bud

| ------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Baby Form     | N/A                             | 1.0                   |
| 1st Phase     | Level 14-35                     | 1.15                  |
| 2nd Phase     | Level 34-55                     | 1.30                  |
| 3rd Phase     | Level 54-75                     | 1.50                  |
| Ascended Form | Level 100, Unique Condition Per | -                     |

- To evolve, bud must spend a certain amount of hours at an Evolution Shrine based on Bud Rarity and Shrine conditions
- Evolution phase affects how much stat a bud can gain per level
- Evolution unlocks new move availability

### Hunters

- Level from 1-100 in every activity
- Gains attribute points to spend on stats at every level

### Evolution Shrine

- Buds of the same affinity can boo

In order to evolve, buds need to be placed in an evolution shrine for X hours. There will be ways to shorten the length of time, minimum and maximum needs to be set.

### Eggs

- Buds cannot be caught, eggs drop as loot and they must be hatched
- Buds can be assigned to hatchery to increase hatch speed, depending on affinity
- Eggs must be placed in the hatchery for X hours to hatch. There will be ways to shorten the length of time, minimum and maximum needs to be set.

## Items

### Tiers

- 8 normal tiers
- 1 ascended tier
- Resources and Items are symmetrical

### Equipment

- Requires a minimum level and relevant stat
- Has elemental bonuses like buds
- Has stat range, so they are always unique\* NOT FOR PROTOTYPE

#### Equipment Stats

### Bud Crafting/Gathering Skills

Buds do not have individual skill levels for tasks like Hunters do, instead their work efficiency is determined by their stats, which is determined by level, IVs, and etc. Passions provide a boost to this.

Buds task ability depends on species, effectiveness depends on affinity and passion

Buds are not able to unlock resource nodes themselves, these must be unlocked by the player.

Buds are able to work on resource nodes without players once unlocked.

## Affinity System

### Intrinsic Values

- 0-100 range for normal buds
- Rare+ buds have minimum ranges that are progressively higher per tier

### Stat Growth

- Base stats increase with level (1-100)
- Equipment provides stat bonuses
- Intrinsic Values provide extra stat increase per level

### Passion System

- Each Bud has specific work passions
- Ranges from 1-5, does not change, there is a minimum level for certain species but you can catch at a range

- Affects efficiency in tasks
- Passions are: - Aquatics (Watering, Fishing) - Kindling (Smelting, Cooking) - Gathering (Lumbering, Mining) - Handiwork (Smithing, Crafting) - Combat
  Task Passions
- Buds typically have primary and secondary task passion
- Some Buds are specialists (one high-level task passion)
- Others are generalists (multiple lower-level task passion)
- Rare Buds have unique task passions
  Buds with Gathering passion can do both lumbering and mining, but their affinity will provide a massive boost depending on task, i.e. grass

# Activities

# Combat

## General

### Rules

#### Battle

- Always 1v1, due to UI constraints
- turn order done live and consistent, just like Melvor. There is no "turn order", certain weapons/buds/NPCs simply hit faster.
- Button to flee, feed, special move, and switch out
- NPCs always have a preset party order for simplicity
- Max party size up to 5, starts with 1, must progress/unlock more slots

### Moves

Normal - Automatically used during Idle
Special - Charges up like pokemon go, player activated

# Other

Bud Box - PokePC for buds
Bud Ball - capture buds NOT FOR PROTOTYPE SCOPE
Bud Bark - basic material needed to create bud balls NOT FOR PROTOTYPE SCOPE

# Gameplay Elements

## Core Mechanics and Systems

### Core Progression Systems

**Specialized Bud Skills**
Each Bud possesses unique abilities aligned with traditional gathering and production skills, creating a deep progression system.

#### Gathering Skills

- Woodcutting Buds specialize in different tree types
- Mining Buds progress through ore tiers
- Fishing Buds master various fishing spots and methods
- Higher-level Buds unlock access to rare resources

#### Parallel Progression Paths

- Buds level individual skills (1-99) through experience
- Hunters progress through equipment tiers and tools
- Equipment quality determines Hunter's resource access
- Skill-specific tools (axes, pickaxes, fishing rods) unlock new gathering options

### Synergy Mechanics

#### Hunter-Bud Cooperation

- Hunters can assist one Bud to boost productivity
- Combined Hunter-Bud efforts yield bonus resources
- Unique interactions based on tool and Bud combinations
- Special gathering events requiring cooperation

#### Activity Management

- Each Bud specializes in one activity at a time
- Strategic assignment of Buds to different resources
- Hunter assistance provides significant efficiency boost
- Resource nodes scale with combined skill levels

### Resource System

#### Progressive Resource Tiers

- Basic resources available to new Hunters and Buds
- Mid-tier resources require skilled Buds or quality tools
- Elite resources demand both high-level Buds and advanced equipment
- Rare resources only accessible through Hunter-Bud cooperation

### Catching

#### Balls

Toggle for idle/afk auto, set catch preference as:
auto, game chooses best
manual, player check marks ball types

#### Active and Passive Catching

Passive Catching - game attempts to throw ball once before a bud dies
Active Catching - player clicks button similar to eating

## Game Modes
